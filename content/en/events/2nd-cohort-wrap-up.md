## Our Journey
- Our group started as a small paper reading group with 2 people.
- We expanded city-wide to welcome talented students from other top tech universities such as 
[Hanoi University of Science and Technology](https://www.linkedin.com/company/dhbkhn/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_detail_base%3BhwG4qBqGQoyFVxGq7uCeHg%3D%3D),
[Vietnam National University, Hanoi](https://www.linkedin.com/company/vietnam-national-university/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_detail_base%3BhwG4qBqGQoyFVxGq7uCeHg%3D%3D), 
and [University of Science and Technology of Hanoi - USTH](https://www.linkedin.com/company/university-of-science-and-technology-of-hanoi-usth/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_detail_base%3BhwG4qBqGQoyFVxGq7uCeHg%3D%3D).
- We hosted intensive Sunday afternoon sessions, 3-4 hours each.
- We organised 2 iterations of the popular BlueDot Impact's AI Safety Fundamentals courses
- Members engaged in numerous discussions, paper deep-dives, and research projects

## Member Testimonials 
- "HAISN got me to seriously consider the prospect that AI risks weren’t just sci-fi, and then gave me
the resources to actually work on mitigating those risks."
- “I was introduced to interesting research areas like mechanistic and developmental interpretability, 
and I think safety research can really use better engineering practices. Along with AI safety, I was 
also introduced to rationality and effective altruism, which is pretty cool.”

## Future Plans
- The group is seeking new leadership as [Hieu Minh Nguyen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hieu-minh-nguyen-74880927a/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_detail_base%3BhwG4qBqGQoyFVxGq7uCeHg%3D%3D)
pursues a research fellowship
