## Session 3: Potential of AI & Introduction to AI Alignment

### TensorTrust Brainstorming

- We played TensorTrust, joined the Discord server for the game, and tried out basic to less basic strategies in an attempt to understand how a prompt injection might work (1 hour)
- We created a docs of strategies that ended up being successful, some more obscure than others.
- Some of us got into top 10 on the leaderboard ;)
- Purplechair had an unbreakable defense which was broken in the evening of the same day.

### Potential of AI & Introduction to AI Alignment

- We went through week 1 + 2 in [BlueDot Impactâ€™s AI Safety Fundamentals Course](https://course.aisafetyfundamentals.com/alignment) (30 mins)
- We talked about how AI could (and in many ways already can) have massive sway over our workspace, politics, and public opinion

#### Intro to Alignment

- We talked about outer and inner misalignment is
- We also discussed some misconceptions that may make it difficult to talk about misalignment:
  - Anthropomorphisation
