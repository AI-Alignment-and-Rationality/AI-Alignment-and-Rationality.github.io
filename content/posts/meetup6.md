### New members

- We spent some time introducing ourselves to the new members and letting the new members introduce themselves to us.
- We talked to each other about the basic argument of AI alignment and why it’s important
- We watched Robert Miles’ “Intro to AI Safety, Remastered” and “10 Reasons to Ignore AI Safety”

### x-risk Debate

- We debated with each other on whether the most important problems of AI Safety is short-medium-term (economic, sociopolitical) or long-term (irreversible turning point in human history), whether that problem would be infrastructural or existential.
- In the end we found agreement in the fact that working on AI Safety is an important endeavor, whether or not AI risk is existential.

### Scalable oversight & Governance

- We watched Robert Miles’ “Iterated amplification and distillation”
- We talked some more talk about governance policies
