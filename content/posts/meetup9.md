## Brainstorming Ideas

- We read a brief post from and tried to come up with potential ideas to work on for Apart Research’s upcoming AI x Democracy research hackathon from May 3rd to May 5th. Here’s some ideas we came up with and discussed: 
  - Kappie & Welsh: Conduct an opinion survey on some demographic of local law students on their use of AI (specifically LLMs) in their academic work, and then write a report based on their findings.
  - Purplechair: Train a demo Twitter (X) bot to test its ability to stifle political discourse (spam, shutting the conversation down aggressively, etc.)
  - Purplechair: Replicate pre-existing findings on political bias in LLMs for non-Western democracies (Brazil, South Korea, etc.)
  - Gumperto: Convince a LLM to come up with/agree with uncontroversial policies with obvious loopholes, preferably policies where the LLM is aware of such a loophole.
  - Mogu: Test LLMs’ ability to fill in redacted words or sections of a document, specifically classified government documents.
  - Jord: Replicate findings about an AI’s ability to act as a sleeper agent, and test whether they are sensitive enough to detect important political events such as election season.

## Self-research

- We couldn’t fully carry out our activity agenda as usual as the brainstorming session took a little too much time, but we spared some time to do our self-research:
  - Jord & Purplechair: Filled out their MATS applications
  - Kappie & Welsh: Read through the Governance curriculum of BlueDot Impact’s AI Safety Fundamentals Course.
  - Mogu: Read through some miscellaneous technical research
  - Gumperto: Tried to get started on the ARENA 3.0 curriculum
