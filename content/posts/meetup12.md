## Individual reading

- 12:30 - 14:45:  Mogu, Jord, and Gumperto get started by doing some individual reading before everyone arrives.
- Jord and Mogu mostly worked on group administration, while Gumperto tried going through the early lessons in the ARENA course.

## Rationality group reading

- 14:45 - 15:55: Qronox and Allen Dulles arrived at the venue around this time, which prompted us to start the group reading related to [scope sensitivity](https://mindingourway.com/on-caring/) and [Moloch](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/).
- We debated with each other on what we should do to be more resistant to scope sensitivity and what ways in which we can address the various Moloch-run systems that plague our world.

## Reinvestigation of AI alignment

- 15:55 - 16:45: We spend some time reinvestigating basic AI safety arguments to see how much weâ€™ve come to understand the field.
