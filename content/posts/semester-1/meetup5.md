Jord&qronox Hanging up posters to invite non group members to join, though no one did.

## Preparation (22/3/2024 - 23/3/2024)

- Jord, Mogu, Qronox, Skrubz worked on the initial phase of coming up with and submitting ideas 

## Jam Time! (23/3/2024 - 24/4/2024)

### 23/3/2024

- On the evening of 23/3/2024, Jord stayed over at Mogu’s for the night apartment to cowork on the specifications (and submit new ideas).
- Specifically, they worked on specifications for these ideas:
  - Open Grants
  - Glitch Tokens
  - Others?
- Meanwhile, Qronox stayed home and continued work on idea submission.

### 24/4/2024

- By morning of 24/4/2024, Gumperto and Qronox came to Mogu’s apartment to join the hackathon:
  - Mogu continued doing the specifications for Glitch Tokens.
  - Jord was trying to figure out implementation.
  - Gumperto (joined late) read through everything in the METR task standard.
  - Qronox also tried to get implementation going.
- In the afternoon, purplechair, Skrubz, and Sparky also arrived to do the jam:
  - purplechair bounced around between idea submission, specification, and implementation. He ended up working on specifications for a Crypto idea.
  - Skrubz provided some helpful ideas for the Crypto specification.
  - Sparky (joined late) read through everything in the METR task standard.
  - Jord gave up on implementation and went back to specifications.
  - Mogu tried to do the specifications for Open Grants, Glitch Tokens, and Crypto.
  - Qronox tried to do the implementations for a WordPress idea, but since the LLM didn’t have the required perms, he switched to doing specifications for a C Compiler idea with Gumperto.
- After an afternoon of hard but unsuccessful work, we went home and continued with our own work, preparing for QA in the coming hours, specifically:
  - Mogu went through a bunch of QA-wanted implementations to try and do one. He found an implementation for Code Obfuscation, and invited purplechair and Gumperto to do it with him. They agreed.
  - Mogu and purplechair stayed up until 12:30 AM, which was when the implementation team messaged us. Unfortunately Gumperto overslept (sorry!) and could not be there for the first few hours.
  - At 3:00 AM, Gumperto woke up and saw the other two already doing work. He booted up his laptop and tried to get some work in.
  - By 4:30 AM, the trio realized they didn’t have the necessary skills to do the QA very well at all. They went back to the implementation team in great shame, but the team handled it very professionally and gave us some encouraging words.
- With that, the jam was (practically) over. While we could still continue making submissions for bounties, the hype died down and we returned to our regular activities. It was quite fun discussing ideas with everyone, even if we perhaps could have been a bit more productive.
