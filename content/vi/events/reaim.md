"... In our pursuit to create systems to end war favourably for our side, 
we have created mechanisms to prolong war forever. All that is left is war. 
A war without humans. War without reason."

As a sci-fi enthusiast, I've long been fascinated by the intersection of technology and the human condition.
The stories we tell have a remarkable way of shaping our collective imagination, often presaging the very risks 
and challenges we now face. It is with this in mind that I crafted my story 
["The Interviewee, the Email, and the Three-Hour War,"](https://www.youth4disarmament.org/interviewee-email-and-three-hour-war?language_content_entity=en) 
which explores the chilling implications of unchecked AI in the military domain. 🤖 ⚠️ 

My story was selected from over 230 global entries by the [Youth4Disarmament Initiative](https://www.youth4disarmament.org/),
a United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs program that has connected me with experts to tackle 
security challenges and promote active participation. 🇺🇳 

I've been invited to present my vision at the 
[Responsible AI in the Military Domain Summit (REAIMSummit 2024)](https://reaim.kr/reaimeng/index.do) 
in Seoul, South Korea. 🇰🇷 

There, I presented the current AI risk landscape and actionable recommendations to stakeholders. I also had 
the privilege of engaging with thought leaders, policymakers, and young visionaries from around the globe. 
This gathering of diverse perspectives served as a powerful reminder that the ethical and catastrophic implications 
of AI in warfare are not mere hypotheticals, but pressing realities that demand our collective attention and action.

Through my research and dialogue with summit participants, I've gained a deeper understanding of the 
current AI risk landscape and the urgent need for comprehensive, collaborative solutions. It is my fervent hope 
that by sharing our stories, our insights, and our collective vision for a safer, more peaceful future, we can 
inspire meaningful change and steer the course of technological progress towards the betterment of humanity. ☮️ 🕊️
