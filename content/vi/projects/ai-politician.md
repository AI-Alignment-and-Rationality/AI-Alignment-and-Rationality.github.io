**Abstract**

This project explores the potential for AI chatbots to enhance participative democracy by allowing a politician to engage with a large number of constituents in personalized conversations at scale. By creating a chatbot that emulates a specific politician and is knowledgeable about a key policy issue, we aim to demonstrate how AI could be used to promote civic engagement and democratic participation.
